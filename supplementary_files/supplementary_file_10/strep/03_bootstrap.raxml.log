WARNING: The model you specified on the command line (GTR+FO) will be ignored 
         since the binary MSA file already contains a model definition.
         If you want to change the model, please re-run RAxML-NG 
         with the original PHYLIP/FASTA alignment and --redo option.

Parallelization scheme autoconfig: 64 worker(s) x 1 thread(s)


NOTE: Per-rate scalers were automatically enabled to prevent numerical issues on taxa-rich alignments.
NOTE: You can use --force switch to skip this check and fall back to per-site scalers.
