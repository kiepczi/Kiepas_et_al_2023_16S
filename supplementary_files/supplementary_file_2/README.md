NOTE: Complete FASTA files are avaliable on Zenodo {ADD INFO when ready and uploaded}. Please download files
and place them in supplementary file 2 before running any scripts found in this or other supplementary files.

- `gg_13_5_taxonomy.txt` - Greengenes taxonomy information txt file
- `gg_map_taxonomy.py` script used to map taxonomy information to all 16S rRNA sequences in Greengenes v13.5 database. To run the script please make sure Biopython and SeqIO module are installed.
